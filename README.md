These manifests describe a fictional game with (what I would think) is the average level of complexity.


## The Game
A DnD-like action-rpg that allows players to use standard spell-deck cards to enhance their stats.

Their are two types of players: `Game Master`s and `Adventurer`s. 

Players MUST have:
- 3 Card Slots (with optional indicator lights)
- A Champion Figurine shipped with the Game
- A RF Stanadard "Spell Deck"

Players MAY have:
- A button pad with 4 buttons

Game Masters MUST have:
- 5 Card slots (with optional indicator lights)
- A Laptop (or tablet or phone) with an authenticated "Game Master's World Builder" software (probably web-based sofware)
- 10 Standard "Raven Fire Tokens" used as enemies

The Community MAY have
- A dice roller
- A single d20 die
- A single d6 die

The gameplay itself isn't important.
